# Student Performance Prediction

## Overview
A machine learning project that predicts student academic performance based on study hours and attendance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
- Data creation and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Run the program:
   python student_performance.py

## Outcome
The model predicts student marks and evaluates accuracy using error metrics.
